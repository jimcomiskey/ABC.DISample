Dirt simple demonstration of Winforms &amp; Ninject

Simple demonstration of using Ninject's Factory extension to generate forms on-demand, and how those forms' dependencies are resolved by Ninject. 

Also demonstrates basic tiered dependency injection, showing Client Engine (business layer) being injected into a Windows Form (ui layer), and a Data Access component (data layer) being injected into the Client Engine.
